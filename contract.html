        <h1>Contract</h1>
        <p>I, Robert K. Lee agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, ITIS3135, Web App Design
            & Development
            with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available
            online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for
            schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
            not
            logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also
            understand
            that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view
            my
            classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste
            code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            Signed:
            Robert K. Lee, 09/08/2024</p>
