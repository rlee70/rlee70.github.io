    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <section class="section-1">
        <h3><a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">Zara.com</a></h3>
        <p>This website is for the popular shopping brand Zara but its design is almost disorienting upon first use.
            There almost appears to be a grey film over it which doesn't let the user click on any elements hidden
            underneath it, due the pop-up alerting the user that they've changed their terms of service. In order to
            close out of it,
            you first need to click on the button that shows options about their cookie usage, select
            your option, and submit that, and only after can you close out of the 'grey-film' button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C - The contrast on this website is sufficient only sometimes, as you first have to click off the
                pop-up, and even after closing the images in the background do not contrast with the logo and some
                buttons for navigating.</li>
            <li>R - As for repetition, there isn't very much that repeats without a good reason. The only thing I found
                was that you can click on menu buttons to bring up the menu, or click the menu itself to have the same
                effect.</li>
            <li>A - The page is aligned pretty well, most of the images in the background either separate the page in 2
                or take up the entirety of it.</li>
            <li>P - The proximity of elements on this page is satisfactory, and eveything is where a user would expect
                it to be.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="section-2">
        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a></h3>
        <p>This website is for another popular shopping brand: Amazon. Its design is pretty standard, and from a user
            standpoint, eveything is easy to navigate and find.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C - The contrast on this website is very well chosen, there isn't very much issue in any pages. Images and white space is clearly separated.</li>
            <li>R - I couldn't find any examples of repetition, and since there's so many elements shown on the page, there isn't any room for it.</li>
            <li>A - The page is aligned well, the images of products take up only the amount of space they need and when 2 products are next to each other, the blank space is continued.</li>
            <li>P - The proximity of elements on this page is good, everything is in the place that you would assume.</li>
        </ul>
