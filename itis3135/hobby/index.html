                The hobby I chose to focus on was soccer. Soccer is a game loved worldwide, and is played with
                a single ball shared by two teams of 11 players. Regulation fields are 110-120 yards long and 70-80
                yards wide. Although at first the sport does appear simple, the niches of the game are where the 
                brilliance of its players shine. Soccer isn't a sport where physical attributes are the end all be all. 
                Unless you're an extreme outlier, (like Usain Bolt, who actually scored 2 goals in his professional debut in Australia) 
                technical ability is the way that most players are able to become successful. For example, Toni Kroos 
                (pictured below) is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders to ever play the sport, 
                and is known for his passing ability and range over the course of his career. Over his 17 years
                of professional play, he amassed an incredible 93.6% completion rate for his 34,115 total 
                attempted passes. When you make the ball do the work, you don't have to do as much yourself, 
                and it's because of this style of play that allowed Kroos to play in over 750 games, until
                he retired at 34, as a true inspiration and icon of the game.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3 class="about-h3">
                I've played soccer since 3rd grade, and I was originally introduced to it by my friends at recess
                because soccer was always the first thing we chose to play. However, after joining a team at my local
                YMCA, I quickly fell in love with the game myself. As an introvert, this was the first opportunity for
                me to be in a team environment outside of school, and being part of a team allowed me to learn many
                things over time, like leadership and relationship skills, as well as how to make friends and bond
                with people that might not share things in common with me. There is only one ball, and because of
                this, soccer is also one of the best ways to learn teamwork, because there are opportunities 
                for individual players to take over, but the majority of the game is either playing defense or 
                passing the ball around in order to build up play and create an opportunity to score; both 
                are team endeavors. Every player on a team has a role, and playing that role to the best of 
                your ability allows others to succeed.
