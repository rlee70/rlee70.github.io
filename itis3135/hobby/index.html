                The hobby I chose to focus on was soccer. Soccer is a game loved worldwide, and is played with
                a single ball shared by two teams of 11 players. Regulation fields are 110-120 yards long and 70-80
                yards wide. Although at first the sport does appear simple, the niches of the game are where the
                brilliance of its players shine. Soccer isn't a sport where physical attributes are the end all be all.
                Unless you're an extreme outlier, (like Usain Bolt, who actually scored 2 goals in his professional
                debut in Australia)
                technical ability is the way that most players are able to become successful. For example, Toni Kroos
                (pictured below) is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders to ever play the sport,
                and is known for his passing ability and range over the course of his career. Over his 17 years
                of professional play, he amassed an incredible 93.6% completion rate for his 34,115 total
                attempted passes. When you make the ball do the work, you don't have to do as much yourself,
                and it's because of this style of play that allowed Kroos to play in over 750 games, until
                he retired at 34, as a true inspiration and icon of the game.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>
                If you couldn't guess, I love soccer. I play on the club soccer team at UNC Charlotte, and I
                started playing in 3rd grade. I was originally introduced to it by my friends at recess
                because soccer was always the first thing we chose to play. However, after joining a team at my local
                YMCA, I quickly fell in love with the game myself. As an introvert, this was the first opportunity for
                me to be in a team environment outside of school, and being part of a team allowed me to learn many
                things over time, like leadership and relationship skills, as well as how to make friends and bond
                with people that might not share things in common with me. There is only one ball, and because of
                this, soccer is also one of the best ways to learn teamwork, because there are opportunities
                for individual players to take over, but the majority of the game is either playing defense or
                passing the ball around in order to build up play and create an opportunity to score; both
                are team endeavors. Every player on a team has a role, and playing that role to the best of
                your ability allows others to succeed.

            <h2>Seasons</h2>
            <h3>
                Because soccer is a worldwide sport, many leagues overseas start at different points of the year than
                leagues in the Americas. For example, LaLiga and the Premier League, the highest divisions in
                Spain and England respectively, start in August and ends in May, with teams playing 38 matches, enough
                for
                one fixture at home and away against every team. However, teams in the MLS here in the United States
                start
                in late February and end in October, playing 34 games, one home and one away against each team. However,
                there are also international tournaments in soccer, like the World Cup, Euros, or Copa America,
                and all take place in the summer during the offseason of European Soccer. This year-round cycle of
                constant play is reminiscent of a certain sentiment that I personally agree with: soccer never stops.

            <h2>How</h2>
            <h3>
                The act of actually playing soccer is very easy and it's not hard to find a field
                near you that works as a playing surface. If you're just getting into the sport, it's
                more fun to go out with a few friends and learn how to play than play with people you don't
                know, and there are many applications out there with the purpose of organizing pickup soccer, like Plei.
                As far as equipment goes, having more soccer balls always helps; a rebounder or flat surface to
                pass the ball against is also a good investment and can help you learn how much power to use when
                swinging your foot to pass or shoot. For cleats, the more expensive ones may seem daunting at first,
                but the quality of material used can go a long way, and be the difference between a 2-month cleat
                and a 2-year cleat. One recommendation I would give to a beginner is the Adidas F50 Pro FG. They
                provide a well rounded mix of style, support, and comfort, along with a slightly wider sole.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <h3>
                The question of "Why play soccer in the first place?" has been around since the sport was first
                invented,
                however the answers to it have changed. At the very simplest level, playing soccer in today's age
                provides
                the opportunity to build not only generational wealth, (with hard work and patience) but fame and
                influence
                as well. Take, for example, 17 year-old Lamine Yamal, a Spanish international who plays for FC Barcelona
                in
                Spain. This summer, he turned 17, and the week after, he won the Euros with the Spanish National team,
                scoring
                a goal against France and assisting 4 throughout the tournament. Incredibly, his 4 assists in this
                tournament
                already bring him to 11th all-time in total assists for all players in the competition. He even recently
                attended
                the Ballon D'or ceremony, which is the award handed out to the best player with the best season and
                ranked
                EIGHTH in the world. Such heights at such a young age is an inspiration to all, and he has all the
                talent
                to back it up. Leo Messi, known to many as the greatest player of all time, joined Inter Miami, and as
                part of
                his contract agreement, is paid in shares of the club, which goes to show just how much money is
                generated
                by the sport.
